# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Introduction

The **Titanic dataset** contains data about the passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it tragically sank on April 15, 1912. The dataset includes various features such as:

- Passenger class
- Age
- Sex
- Fare
- Survival status

The goal of this analysis is to explore and visualize the dataset to understand the factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is widely used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning tasks, as it provides insights into how different variables impacted the likelihood of survival. This analysis aims to:

1. Pre-process the dataset to handle missing values and categorical features.
2. Visualize the data to identify potential trends and patterns.
3. Apply machine learning models to predict the survival status of passengers.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the Titanic dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model building.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and modeling.
- `models/`: Trained models used for survival prediction.

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.
